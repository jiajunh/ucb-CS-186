/**
 * LockManager maintains the bookkeeping for what transactions have
 * what locks on what resources. The lock manager should generally **not**
 * be used directly: instead, code should call methods of LockContext to
 * acquire/release/promote/escalate locks.
 *
 * The LockManager is primarily concerned with the mappings between
 * transactions, resources, and locks, and does not concern itself with
 * multiple levels of granularity (you can and should treat ResourceName
 * as a generic Object, rather than as an object encapsulating levels of
 * granularity, in this class).
 *
 * It follows that LockManager should allow **all**
 * requests that are valid from the perspective of treating every resource
 * as independent objects, even if they would be invalid from a
 * multigranularity locking perspective. For example, if LockManager#acquire
 * is called asking for an X lock on Table A, and the transaction has no
 * locks at the time, the request is considered valid (because the only problem
 * with such a request would be that the transaction does not have the appropriate
 * intent locks, but that is a multigranularity concern).
 *
 * Each resource the lock manager manages has its own queue of LockRequest objects
 * representing a request to acquire (or promote/acquire-and-release) a lock that
 * could not be satisfied at the time. This queue should be processed every time
 * a lock on that resource gets released, starting from the first request, and going
 * in order until a request cannot be satisfied. Requests taken off the queue should
 * be treated as if that transaction had made the request right after the resource was
 * released in absence of a queue (i.e. removing a request by T1 to acquire X(db) should
 * be treated as if T1 had just requested X(db) and there were no queue on db: T1 should
 * be given the X lock on db, and put in an unblocked state via Transaction#unblock).
 *
 * This does mean that in the case of:
 *    queue: S(A) X(A) S(A)
 * only the first request should be removed from the queue when the queue is processed.
